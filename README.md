# PH_PHIBL_PresetLoad (IPA)

This plugin loads your selected PHIBL settings in the main game for you.  

**Installation**  
* Drop the PH_PHIBL_PresetLoad.dll in `Plugins/`.  

**Configuration**  
* Go in the studio, configure your PHIBL to the settings you want, save the scene.  
* Go in `UserData/studio/scene` and rename the created `name.png.extdata` to `default_PHIBL_maingame.extdata`.  
* Place the renamed file into `UserData/`.  
* Playing the main game should load the file automatically. If it's missing - it won't be loaded.  

**Notes**  
* Not all settings are currently saved, but most are. I will finish the rest when I get more time.  

**Coming soon**  
* Saving LUT settings, other missing settings.  

**Currently not saved (wait for next release)**

* Perception -> LUT
