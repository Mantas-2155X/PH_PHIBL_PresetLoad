# PH_PHIBL_PresetLoad (IPA)

This plugin loads your selected PHIBL settings in the main game for you.  

**Installation**  
* If your PHIBL is the nyaacho custom build:  Drop the PH_PHIBL_PresetLoad_Nyaacho.dll in `Plugins/`.  
* If your PHIBL is the the original build:  Drop the PH_PHIBL_PresetLoad_Original.dll in `Plugins/`.  
* Make sure to remove old one if it's there!  


**Configuration**  
* Go in the studio, configure your PHIBL to the settings you want, save the scene.  
* Go in `UserData/` and rename the created `temp_PHIBL_MainGame.extdata` to `PHIBL_MainGame.extdata`.  
* Playing the main game should load the file automatically. If it's missing - it won't be loaded.
