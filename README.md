# PH_PHIBL_PresetLoad (IPA)

This plugin loads your selected PHIBL settings in the game for you.  

Presets saved with selected scenes will automatically load when the selected scene is loaded.
Conflicting presets which are set to load on the same scenes will not automatically load and will be marked.

If you're updating from a previous version (<2.0.0), to load your old preset file, please refer to the **Loading legacy presets** section below.
